    "bio": "To be a Junior Developer, I would like to learn how to create interpersonal relationships and be able to foster a cooperative mentality. I am dedicated to providing value by being capable of problem solving as an independent asset to a team environment. As far as technology, I am truly inspired by the React library and it's component based architecture. While studying development, I was able to touch on a high level overview of many different technologies such as : HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask, MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js. For me, there is a sort of seamless nature to the way I can wrap my mind around React, which inspires me to continue my studies. I aspire to continue to complete a Bachelor's in Computer Science and slip into an entry level development position, so that I may acquire a real world experience of what it is really like to develop with a team and grow as a Developer.",
